# *Weather Finite State Machine Simulation*

### Description: 
This project simulates a weather cycle for 7 days using a Finite State Machine (FSM) in Java. The FSM models different weather states and transitions based on random events. The states include Clear, Cloudy, Raining, and Severe Weather, while the events consist of changes in temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

### How to Run The Program: 
First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git/Github. After cloning the repository, navigate to the src folder, where the WeatherFSM.java file is located, and double-click to open it with your java supported IDE. Run the program, and you will see the output directly on your terminal or command prompt. The simulation will run for 7 days, with each day consisting of 5 event changes, demonstrating the FSM's behavior with different weather states and events.
